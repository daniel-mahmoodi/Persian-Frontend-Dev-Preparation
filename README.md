## Welcome to the Persian-Frontend-Dev-Preparation wiki!

In this repository, our goal is to provide support and guidance to Persian front-end developers, helping them prepare for opportunities in foreign countries where English is the primary language. We aim to equip developers with commonly used sentences, phrases, and words essential for effective communication in English, specifically in the context of front-end development jobs. Through this resource, developers can enhance their language skills and confidence, making them well-prepared for successful collaborations and work experiences in an English-speaking environment.
